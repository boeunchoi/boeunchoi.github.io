      abstract = {Young planetary nebulae (PNe) retain a large amount of neutral material that was shed in the previous asymptotic giant branch stage. The thick H I region in young PNe can be effectively probed by illuminating far-UV radiation that may be inelastically scattered to appear in the optical region. Raman-scattered features are unique spectroscopic tracers of neutral regions that can be used to investigate the mass-loss process in young PNe. We conduct high-resolution spectroscopy of young PNe using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) and report the discovery of a Raman-scattered He II feature at 6545 Å in NGC 6886 and NGC 6881. The Raman-scattered He II features have been found in only five PNe so far, and in particular, it is the first direct detection of an H I component in NGC 6881. The Raman He II λ6545 features in the two PNe are observed to be redshifted with respect to He II λ6560, indicating that the neutral regions are expanding. We perform line profile analyses using the grid-based Monte Carlo code "STaRS" by assuming a neutral hydrogen region in the shape of a partial spherical shell expanding radially. The profiles are well fitted with the model parameters of covering factor CF = 0.3, H I column density {N_{\rm HI} = 5 \times 10^20 \rm cm^{-2}}, and expansion speed {v_{\rm exp} = 25\ \rm km\ s^{-1}} for NGC 6886 and CF = 0.6, {N_{\rm HI} = 3 \times 10^20 \rm cm^{-2}}, and {v_{\rm exp} = 30\ \rm km\ s^{-1}}  for NGC 6881, respectively.}

  title = {Line Formation of Raman-scattered He II {\lambda} 4851 in an Expanding Spherical H I Shell in Young Planetary Nebulae},
  abstract = {We investigate line formation of Raman-scattered He II at 4851 Å in an expanding neutral, spherical shell that surrounds a point-like He II source located at the center. A new grid-based Monte Carlo code is used to take into consideration the H I density variation along each photon path. In the case of a monochromatic He II emission source, the resultant line profiles are characterized by an asymmetric double-peak structure with a tertiary peak and a significant red tail that may extend to the line centers of He IIλ4859 and Hβ. The peak separation corresponds to the expansion velocity, which we consider is in the range 20-40 km s-1 in this work. Tertiary red peaks are formed as a result of multiple Rayleigh reflections at the inner surface of a hollow, spherical shell of H I. Due to a sharp increase of scattering cross section near resonance, the overall Raman conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced as the expansion speed increases. In the case of a He II line source with a Gaussian line profile with an FWHM of 30-70 km s-1, we obtain distorted redward profiles that are due to the increasing redward cross section of H I. A simple application to the young planetary nebula IC 5117 is consistent with a neutral shell expanding with a speed ∼30 km s-1.},
