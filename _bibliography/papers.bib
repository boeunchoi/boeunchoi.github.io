  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title = {Line Formation of Raman-scattered He II {\lambda} 4851 in an Expanding Spherical H I Shell in Young Planetary Nebulae},
  abstract = {We investigate line formation of Raman-scattered He II at 4851 Å in an expanding neutral, spherical shell that surrounds a point-like He II source located at the center. A new grid-based Monte Carlo code is used to take into consideration the H I density variation along each photon path. In the case of a monochromatic He II emission source, the resultant line profiles are characterized by an asymmetric double-peak structure with a tertiary peak and a significant red tail that may extend to the line centers of He IIλ4859 and Hβ. The peak separation corresponds to the expansion velocity, which we consider is in the range 20-40 km s-1 in this work. Tertiary red peaks are formed as a result of multiple Rayleigh reflections at the inner surface of a hollow, spherical shell of H I. Due to a sharp increase of scattering cross section near resonance, the overall Raman conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced as the expansion speed increases. In the case of a He II line source with a Gaussian line profile with an FWHM of 30-70 km s-1, we obtain distorted redward profiles that are due to the increasing redward cross section of H I. A simple application to the young planetary nebula IC 5117 is consistent with a neutral shell expanding with a speed ∼30 km s-1.},
