I'm an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Washington. My main [research interest](/research/) is the baryon cycle in galaxies -- understanding how baryonic matter is accreted into galaxies, how it fuels galactic star formation, and how it is recycled, in particular, by stellar feedback. I'm also passionate about how massive stars evolve and die, exploring their unique evolutionary history and impacts on their surroundings. Spectroscopy is my favorite tool to find hints on these cosmic scenes.

<!-- "Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to see." - Vincent van Gogh --> 

The 12-year-old me had no idea to be an astronomer. At that time, I went to an art school in Korea, dreaming of being a painter. The only thing I knew clearly was my admiration for nature and desire to find its beauty and show it to people so they could see it. I found myself enjoying observe nature and study principles that make it beautiful rather than expressing it on canvas, which led me to science. I still dream the same dream-- I deeply admire the Universe and try to understand it, and I truly hope my tiny findings show people a tiny pebble of our Universe.
