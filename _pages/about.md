I'm an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Washington. My main [research interest](/research/) is the baryon cycle in galaxies -- understanding how baryonic matter is accreted into galaxies, how it fuels galactic star formation, and how it is recycled particularly by stellar feedback. I'm also passionate about how massive stars evolve and die because each of them has a unique history and a considerable impact on their environment. I love to explore spectra and find hints to answer these questions.
