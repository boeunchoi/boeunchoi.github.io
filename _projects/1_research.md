In Seattle, a city famous for its cloudy and rainy days during much of the year, and where I am doing my PhD, I often reflect on the impact of the atmosphere on the environment and life below. Clouds often form dynamic patterns &mdash; sometimes scattered in patches, other times covering the entire sky (which gave a spectacular view of solar eclipse in 2024). While observing these skies, I often find myself imagining clouds stretching across the entire Milky Way's sky and what the "weather" of our galaxy might look like.

Similar to Earth, galaxies are surrounded by an atmosphere known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Extending to the galaxy's virial radius (and beyond), this diffuse, multiphase medium is thought to contain a substantial mass and serve as a gas budget for galactic star formation. I am interested in the CGM from the perspective of the baryon cycle, particularly connecting the CGM and central galaxy.

The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a good laboratory to test our understanding There have been many works on our Milky Way galaxy's CGM owing to ample observations with high data quality.

<!-- Galaxies are surrounded by a gaseous halo, so does our Milky Way. It features an atmosphere of the galaxies known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Unlike Earth's atmosphere, which extends to heights comparable to Earth's radius and has a mass on the order of one-millionth that of Earth, the CGM typically extends to the virial radius of the galaxy -- approximately 300 kpc for the Milky Way, which has the radius is about 15 kpc -- and is thought to contain a much greater mass than that of the central galaxy itself. -->
